      <description>&amp;ldquo;Words are windows&amp;rdquo; is an introduction to non violent communication (abbreviated as NVC). Marshall Rosenberg presents in this book the process that allows us to communicate more serenely with others as well as with ourselves. This mode of communication allows us to become more and more caring, authentic, and empathic with others. It can therefore be used in all interactions of everyday life: as a couple, with our children, at work &amp;hellip; NVC is proving to be a very effective way to manage conflicts, and also to better identify our own needs.</description>
